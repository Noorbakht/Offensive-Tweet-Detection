# Offensive Tweet Detection

This project is part of 50.038 Computational Data Science Module (SUTD).

Our team aims to explore the data science segment of Multi-Class Text Classification, specifically in the sphere of offensive language detection. Using labelled twitter data, we explored various text embedding methods, followed with the implementation of statistical and deep learning models for hierarchical class prediction.
